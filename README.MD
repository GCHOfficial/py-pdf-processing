# py-pdf-processing

A simple PDF processor made with the help of PyPDF2 and PyQt.

# Foreward

This is the second consistent project I've created using Python and community libs. After studying the first project ([py-image-processing](https://github.com/GCHOfficial/py-image-processing)), I understood that I should pay attention to clarity/readability as, although I understand what I wrote, other people might struggle to get it. The code of this project has a clear structure delimited by comments which makes it much easier to follow.

# Functions

- Merge PDF files
- Batch Split PDF files by page
- Single PDF split in two at specified page number
- Batch PDF Watermarking
- PDF encryption and decryption
- Automatic secure password generation (with copy to clipboard on textbox click)

# Release

Windows and Linux executables have been generated using GitHub Actions, then released along with the source code, and they can be found [here](https://github.com/GCHOfficial/py-pdf-processing/releases/tag/0.1.0).
