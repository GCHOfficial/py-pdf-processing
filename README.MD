# py-pdf-processing
A simple PDF processor made with the help of PyPDF2 and PyQt.

# Foreward
This is the second consistent project I've created using Python and community libs. After studying the first one, I understood that I should pay attention to clarity/readability as, although I understand what I coded, other people might not get much. The code of this project has a clear structure delimited by comments which makes the code much easier to follow.

# Functions
* Merge PDF files
* Batch Split PDF files by page
* Single PDF split in two at specified page number
* Batch PDF Watermarking
* PDF encryption and decryption
* Automatic secure password generation (with copy to clipboard on textbox click)

# Release
